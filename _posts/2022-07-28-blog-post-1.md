From Sat 23-Fri 29, July 2022, I'm pushing myself to learn new skills for data analysis and large scale modeling. The DSOS/AEMON-J Hacking Limnology 2022 workshop provides an additional material links to The Reproducible Research with R workshop (by CEREO). I fould the CEREO workshop is good for beginner and I will write down my note (+sucessful or failed exercises) from all the lessons I have learned this week.
This note is for the github acedamicpages, a free website, that we can "easily" share our profile and project when we are familiar with it. 
I found it is not easy (not yet), you need to be careful about the format of dates and file names.I want to edit text style, how to add list, and photo position.
This Head part is really huge and I'm not sure if we need it
======
This is another head, also big
======

I don't like the deading to be here, it should be on top of a post
------
Then, If I try writing something below the heads... and ramdomly add a photo of mom and me here.
