I learned using R tidyverse package from the Reproducible Research workshop organized by CEREO (recorded).
What I like is the verbs "filter" (choose the rows) and "select" (choose the columns), and the pipeline "%>%". This is much easier than matlab when working with a dataset.
Here is the result at the end.  
We can plot subfigures differentiated by groups(season), and also draw the fitting lines by a short coding.

ggplot(data=bike)+
  geom_point(aes(x=temp,y=cnt)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=temp,y=cnt), 
              method ="lm",
              formula=y~poly(x,2))+
  facet_wrap(~ season)+
ylab("number of riders")
